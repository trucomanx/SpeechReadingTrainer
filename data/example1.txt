The Little Fox and the River

Once upon a time, there was a little fox who lived in a big green forest. He loved to run and play every day. One morning, he woke up early and decided to explore a new part of the forest. As he walked, he saw a shiny river sparkling in the sunlight. He wanted to drink water, but the river looked deep and wide.

On the way to the river, he met a friendly rabbit. The rabbit smiled and said, "Hello! Do you want to play with me?" The little fox was happy and nodded. They ran together, jumped over fallen logs, and chased butterflies. After a while, they reached the river. The little fox drank water and felt refreshed.

The rabbit and the fox sat by the river and watched the birds fly above. The sun began to go down, and it was time to go home. The little fox said goodbye to his new friend and walked back to his den. He felt happy and tired from a day full of fun and adventure. Every day after that, he looked forward to playing with his friend again.
